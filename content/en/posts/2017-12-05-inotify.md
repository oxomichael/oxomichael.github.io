title: Using inotify
---

## Description
`inotify` allows you to add a watch descriptor to a file and send notifications to the system when an event affects that file. As a reminder, in the UNIX world, a file can represent a simple file, but also a directory, a device, a link, etc.

The main events that can be monitored are:

- `IN_ACCESS`: the file is read;
- `IN_MODIFY`: the file is modified;
- `IN_ATTRIB`: the file attributes are modified;
- `IN_OPEN`: the file is opened;
- `IN_CLOSE_WRITE`: the file is closed after being opened for writing;
- `IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE`: the file is closed after being opened for reading;
- `IN_MOVED_FROM` / `IN_MOVED_TO`: the file has been moved or renamed;
- `IN_DELETE_SELF`: the file has been deleted;
- `IN_DELETE`: a file has been deleted in the watched directory;
- `IN_CREATE`: a file has been created in the watched directory.

## Incron
To install `incron`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install incron
```
Once the installation is complete, you need to add the users authorized to use `incron` in the `/etc/incron.allow` file.
```bash
$ cat /etc/incron.allow
myuser
```

### Usage
Add a file for each task/directory to watch in `/etc/incron.d/`.
```
/my/watch/dir IN_CLOSE_WRITE php task.php --file $@/$#
```
**Note:** `incron` does not handle recursion.

## inotify-tools
### Installation
```bash
sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
```

### Description
`inotify-tools` provides a way to call `inotify` directly from the command line.

#### inotifywait
This command allows you to wait for an event before continuing execution.
For example, to avoid executing a command that requires a file and falling into error:

```bash
inotifywait -e close_write /var/run/jboss.pid && supervision_jboss.sh
```

The `-t` (timeout) option allows you to set a timeout in seconds, for example, to exit an error if an event takes too long to arrive:

```bash
backup.sh & ; inotifywait -e close_write -t 10000 backup_report || killall backup.sh
```

#### inotifywatch
`inotifywatch` generates an activity report when events occur on the directories you are watching:

```bash
$ inotifywatch /var/cache/apt/archives &
[1] 18607
root@work:~# Establishing watches...
Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.

root@work:~# apt-get autoclean
root@work:~# kill %1
total  access  close_write  close_nowrite  open  delete  filename
1919   7       1            2              3     1906    /var/cache/apt/archives/
```
By default, `inotifywatch` stops when it receives an interrupt signal. A timeout option (`-t`) also exists to stop it after the specified number of seconds.
Watch activities in a user's directory for one minute:

```bash
$ inotifywatch -r /home/user/ -t 60
Establishing watches...
Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.
total  access  modify  close_write  close_nowrite  open  moved_from  moved_to  create  filename
16     3       3       2            0              2     2           2         2       /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/e3lq4lm3.default/
13     11      0       0            1              1     0           0         0       /home/user/.cache/myapp/mycache/
```

### Set Up a Watcher Script
To conclude, here is how to set up a watcher script to run `inotifywait` and send the output to a command. For example, you can create a `watch.sh` file with this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

WATCH_PATH=/var/watch/dir/
PHP_BIN=/usr/bin/php

inotifywait -rme move,close_write,delete --format "%e %w%f" "$WATCH_PATH" | while read -r file; do
  "$PHP_BIN" console cmd:opt "${file}"
done
```

#### Run the Watcher in the Background
```bash
chmod +x watch.sh
./watch.sh
[Ctrl+z]
bg
disown -h
```
