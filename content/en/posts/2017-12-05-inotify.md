title: Using inotify
---

## Description
With inotify you could add a watch descriptor on a file, and send notifications to the system when an event affect the file. As a reminder, in the UNIX world, a file can represent a simple file as well as a directory, a device, a link, etc.

The main events that can be followed are :

    IN_ACCESS : the file is read ;
    IN_MODIFY : the file is modified ;
    IN_ATTRIB : the file attributs are modified ;
    IN_OPEN : the file is open ;
    IN_CLOSE_WRITE : the file is closed after being opened for writing ;
    IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE : the file is closed after being opened for reading ;
    IN_MOVED_FROM / IN_MOVED_TO : the file has been moved or renamed ;
    IN_DELETE_SELF : the file has been deleted ;
    IN_DELETE : a file has been deleted in the watch directory ;
    IN_CREATE : a file has been created in the watch directory ;

## Incron
`$ apt-get install incron`
When install is completed, you need to insert users, which authorize to use incron, in the file `/etc/incron.allow`
```
$ cat /etc/incron.allow
myuser
```

### Usage
Add a file for each task / directory to watch in `/etc/incron.d/`
```
/my/watch/dir IN_CLOSE_WRITE php task.php --file $@/$#
```
Note : No recursivity with incron

## inotify-tools
### Install inotify Tools
`$ apt-get install inotify-tools`

### Description
inotify-tools give the way to call inotify directly from the command line.

#### inotifywait
With this command you can wait an event before to continue the execution.
For example, to avoid executing a command which need a file and fall in error :

```bash
$ inotifywait -e close_write /var/run/jboss.pid && supervision_jboss.sh
```

The -t (timeout) option allows you to set a timeout in seconds, for example, to get out of error if an event is too long :

```bash
$ backup.sh & ; inotifywait -e close_write -t 10000 backup_report || killall backup.sh
```

#### inotifywatch
inotifywatch make an activity report when events occured on your watching directories :

```bash
$ inotifywatch /var/cache/apt/archives &
[1] 18607
root@work:~# Establishing watches...
Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.

root@work:~# apt-get autoclean
root@work:~# kill %1
total  access  close_write  close_nowrite  open  delete  filename
1919   7       1            2              3     1906    /var/cache/apt/archives/
```
By default, inotifywath stop when it receive an interruption signal. Also a timeout option (-t) exist to stop after the number of second specify.
Watch activities in user directory during one minute :

```bash
$ inotifywatch -r /home/user/ -t 60
Establishing watches...
Finished establishing watches, now collecting statistics.
total  access  modify  close_write  close_nowrite  open  moved_from  moved_to  create  filename
16     3       3       2            0              2     2           2         2       /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/e3lq4lm3.default/
13     11      0       0            1              1     0           0         0       /home/user/.cache/myapp/mycache/
```

### Set Up a Watcher Script
And to conclude, set up a watcher script to run inotifywait and send the output to a command. For example, you can create a sample watch file with this content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

WATCH_PATH=/var/watch/dir/
PHP_BIN=/usr/bin/php

inotifywait -rme move,close_write,delete --format "%e %w%f" $WATCH_PATH | while read file; do
  $PHP_BIN console cmd:opt "${file}"
done
```

Run the Watcher in the Background
```bash
$ chmod +x watch
$ ./watch
[Ctrl+z]
$ bg
$ disown -h
```
